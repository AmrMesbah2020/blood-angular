In some cases, testosterone may cause your haemoglobin levels (a protein in your blood that transports oxygen) to increase to above the acceptable range for donation. Don’t worry, though — we test your haemoglobin level before each donation and if it’s within the acceptable range on the day, you can donate.</p>
